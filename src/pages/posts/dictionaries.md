You may have seen something that resembles dictionaries in languages like Java or JavaScript through their implementation of this same kind of structure, the `HashMap` (Java) and `Map` (JavaScript).

Dictionaries (also known as `dict`) are data structures based on key, value pairs, i.e, each element is indexed with a another, immutable type of data.

```python
myDict = { "first": 1, ("first", "last"): 2 }
```
