## Astro First Project

Most of this project was made on top of [Astro's Getting Started](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) guide, I've changed some things like the addiction of Tailwind and my own blog styles but most of the core things is still here.

This project is deployed on both [Netfily](https://astro-pilot.netlify.app/) and [GitHub Pages](https://reinaldorm.github.io/astro-pages/) though the former may be more up-to-date.

You can clone this repository if you want and make it of you own, I would love to see external improvements and I'm assuming that you know how to clone a repository so good luck.
